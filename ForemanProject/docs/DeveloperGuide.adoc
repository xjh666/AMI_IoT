== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
. *Android Studio* IDE

=== Importing the project into Eclipse

.  Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
.  Open Android Studio 
.  Click `File` > `New` >`Import Project...`
.  Locate the project's directory and select `ForemanProject`
.  Click `OK`

=== Troubleshooting project setup

* Problem: Android Studio reports compile errors after new commits are pulled from Git*

* Reason: Android Studio fails to recognize new files that appeared due to the Git pull.
* Solution: Refresh the project in Android Studio: Click `Build` > `Rebuild Project` 

=== Updating documentation

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will link to the wrong repo. You should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in DeveloperGuide.adoc with the URL of your fork.

== Design
