== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
. *Android Studio* IDE

=== Importing the project into Eclipse

.  Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer.
.  Open Android Studio .
.  Click `File` > `New` >`Import Project...`.
.  Locate the project's directory and select `ForemanProject`.
.  Click `OK`.

=== Troubleshooting project setup

* Problem: Android Studio reports compile errors after new commits are pulled from Git*.

* Reason: Android Studio fails to recognize new files that appeared due to the Git pull.
* Solution: Refresh the project in Android Studio: Click `Build` > `Rebuild Project`.

=== Updating documentation

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will link to the wrong repo. You should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in DeveloperGuide.adoc with the URL of your fork.

== Design

=== UI component

==== Login Page

* link:{repoURL}/ForemanProject/app/src/main/java/com/example/foremanproject/activity/Login.java[`Login`] & link:{repoURL}/ForemanProject/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_login.xml[`activity_login`].
* This page is designed as an activity.
* The UI of this page is designed completely in the xml file.
* It is resposible for getting and storing the user's info.

==== Monitor Page

* This page is designed as an activity with three fragments for viewing dashboard, host list and host group list.
* The fragments are shown in the `content_frame` of link:{repoURL}/ForemanProject/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_monitorpage.xml[`activity_monitorpage`].
* The fragments are swtiched by the navigation drawer `nvView`.

===== Dashboard

* The framework is designed in link:{repoURL}/ForemanProject/app/src/main/res/layout/fragment_dashboard.xml[`fragment_dashboard`].
* The content including the tables and graphs are set programmatically in link:{repoURL}/ForemanProject/app/src/main/java/com/example/foremanproject/fragment/Dashboard.java[`Dashboard`].
* The color code for the status table and the pie chart is in link:{repoURL}/ForemanProject/app/src/main/res/layout/colors.xml[`colors`].
* The grid of the Latest Event table is link:{repoURL}/ForemanProject/app/src/main/res/drawable/cell_shape.xml[`cell_shape`].

===== Host List

* For both fragment link:{repoURL}/ForemanProject/app/src/main/java/com/example/foremanproject/fragment/AllHosts.java[`AllHosts`] and activity link:{repoURL}/ForemanProject/app/src/main/java/com/example/foremanproject/activity/HostsOfAHostGroup.java[`HostsOfAHostGroup`].
* The content including the status icon, host name and `EDIT` button are set in the java file programmatically.
* The framework is in link:{repoURL}/ForemanProject/app/src/main/res/layout/list.xml[`list`].

===== Host Group List

* The framework is designed in link:{repoURL}/ForemanProject/app/src/main/res/layout/list.xml[`list`].
* The content including host group name, `ALL` button and `EDIT` button are set programmatically in link:{repoURL}/ForemanProject/app/src/main/java/com/example/foremanproject/fragment/HostGroups.java[`HostGroups`].


==== Editing Page
* The framework is designed in link:{repoURL}/ForemanProject/app/src/main/res/layout/list.xml[`list`].
* The contents including puppet class name, original info icon, parameter name, value and two buttons are are set programmatically in link:{repoURL}/ForemanProject/app/src/main/java/com/example/foremanproject/activity/Parameters.java[`Parameters`].
* The popup window is link:{repoURL}/ForemanProject/app/src/main/java/com/example/foremanproject/activity/ParameterInfo.java[`ParameterInfo`], which is an activity with smaller size.

=== Implementation

==== Network with foreman system
* As the security certificate of foreman url is not trusted by Android OS, link:{repoURL}/ForemanProject/app/src/main/java/com/example/foremanproject/other/NukeSSLCerts.java[`NukeSSLCerts`] is used to make the app trust all certificates.
* Library link:https://developer.android.com/training/volley/index.html[Volley] is used for network tosend request to the foreman server.
* The url, username and password(for api and header of request) and screen size(used for flexible UI for different devices) is stored if login is successful in link:{repoURL}/ForemanProject/app/src/main/java/com/example/foremanproject/other/Configuration.java[`Configuration`]. 

==== Dashboard
* The pie chart and histogram is drawn by using link:http://achartengine.org/[AChartEngine].
* The fragment starts a repeating task with period of 30 seconds.
* `"GET /api/dashboard"` is used to get information related to Host Configuration Chart and Host Configuration Status.
** This api returns a JSONObject containing the number of hosts in different status.
* `"GET /api/reports"` is used to get information related to Run Distribution in the last 30 minutes and Latest Events.
** This api returns a JSONObject containing a list of reports within the past 40 minutes, which are in chronological order.

==== Host Group List
* `"GET /api/hostgroups"` is used to get all host groups and the details.
* Each button is set programmatically with a tag to clarify which instruction to implement.
** The tag of `ALL` is the host group's name followed by an 's' (show all hosts).
** The tag of `EDIT` is the host group's name followed by an 'e' (edit).
* When adding buttons, OnClickListener is also set.
** If `ALL` is clicked, activity HostsOfAHostGroup will be started.
** If `EDIT` is clciked, `"GET /api/hostgroups/:hostgroup_id"` is used repeatedly to get the hierachy of the host group, which will be used to detect inherited value of parameters. Finally, statr the `Parameters` activity.

==== Host List
* For the list of all hosts, `"GET /api/hosts"` is used.
* For the list of hosts of a host group, `"GET /api/hostgroups/:hostgroup_id/hosts"` is used.
* The `EDIT` button is set with tag of the button's name.
* When clicked 'EDIT', `"GET /api/hosts"` is used again to get the info of the host. Then '"GET /api/hostgroups"' and `"GET /api/hostgroups/:hostgroup_id" will be used to get the hierachy of the host's host group. Finally, statr the `Parameters` activity.
